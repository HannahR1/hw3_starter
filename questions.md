## 1. Game characteristics (30)

For each of the following statements, say whether it is true or false and provide a short (e.g. one paragraph) justification for your answer.

1.1 Given a two-player, turn-taking, zero-sum, fully observable game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player's outcome to know what strategy the second player is using -- that is, what move the second player will make, given the first player's move.

FASLE.

The first player could already infer the strategy of the first player because the game is two-player, turn taking and fully observable. Either one player wins/looses or they both tie. For example in the game of checkers if the players are rational, each player would make the move that that is the best move for themselves, and against the other player. They player would know that they must plan their moves in advance so that they could move the best peice possible for both the present and the future states of the game. This planning is the strategy which can be observed and maybe even estimated by the opponeny especially of they know thier first move.  Therefore, knowing the strategy of hte other player, in this case, player 2, helps player 1 because it provides player1 additional insight to the problem that would be useful to imorove thier chances of winning. 

1.2 Given a two-player, turn-taking, zero-sum, partially observable game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player to know what move the second player will make, given the first player's move.

TRUE. 
If the first player is in a partitally obersvable game they do not know what state the opponent is in, or they may not even knwo what state they themselves are in. If there is not clear set information about the players state, it is dificult to estimate player 2's strategy. Therefore, even if player 1 were to know what move player 2 would make, this would not be enough information to improve the chances of player 2 winning. 

1.3 A perfectly rational backgammon-playing agent with unlimited resources never loses.
FALSE.

## 2. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (20)

2.1 We covered several heuristics for CSP search. Explain why when selecting a variable to assign a value next, it is a good to choose the variable that is most constrained, but the value that is least constraining.
